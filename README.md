# CLI
My command line interface projects

The files of note here are:
- CursesTools.py: This is the most up-to-date version of my terminal menu library. This is what you should use if you would actually like to use this library.
- MyDataTypes.py: These are my own, self-designed implementations of the stack, queue, and linked list(used for stacks and queues) abstract data types. These are used to facilitate the menus above, so are important. This was my first dive into developing my own abstract data type implementations.
- cursesInput.py: This is the input management file. Designed to ease input systems for curses based games. Not done, but should be functional.
- testing2.py: This is an example file of what the use of the menu system looks like from CursesTools.
- SnakeFINAL, GameofLife, tictactoe: These are all games I built for my intro CS class final project and as independent projects.

cursesMenu.py is an old version of the cursesTools library. Some of the other files are built on it, and I have not migrated them yet.
